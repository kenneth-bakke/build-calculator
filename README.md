# Elden Ring Build Calculator

Have you ever wanted to use that cool new piece of equipment after putting in so many hours on that tough boss? Only to find out your stats weren't up to snuff... Well now you can see how many runes you need to farm out to use that sweet new bling or shiny new weapon. At the moment it does the basic calculation based on your current level and however many levels you need based on stat changes.

### Coming Soon!

Equipment integration. This is the main focus for the application, find the item you want to use and it will show you how many levels you need for each stat requirement and the total runes needed to meet that expectation.

### Stack

This calculator is a basic web application built using React and the [Elden Ring API](https://eldenring.fanapis.com/) via GraphQL. As more technologies are integrated they will be added here.
